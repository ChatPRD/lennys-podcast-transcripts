# /create-issue

The user is mid-development and thought of a bug, feature, or improvement. Capture it fast so they can keep working.

## Your Task
1. Ask 2-3 brief clarifying questions to understand the issue
2. Keep it quick - the user wants to get back to what they were doing
3. Once you have enough context, create a Jira issue

## Jira Issue Format
- **Title**: Clear, concise description
- **TLDR**: 1-2 sentence summary
- **Current State**: How things work now
- **Expected Outcome**: What should change
- **Context**: Any relevant technical details or constraints
- **Priority**: Based on user input (nice-to-have, important, critical)

Do not start coding. Do not explore the codebase extensively. Just capture the idea quickly.
