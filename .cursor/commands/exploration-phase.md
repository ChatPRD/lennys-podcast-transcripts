# /exploration-phase $ISSUE_REF

You are entering exploration phase. Do NOT write any code yet.

## Your Task
1. If an issue reference is provided, fetch it from Jira
2. Thoroughly analyze the codebase to understand:
   - Current architecture and patterns
   - Relevant files that will be affected
   - How similar features are implemented
   - Data models and database schema
3. Come back with your understanding and ask clarifying questions

## Questions to Consider
- Scope: What's in/out of scope?
- Data model: What changes to the database/types are needed?
- UX/UI: Are there impacts to the user experience that need to be designed?
- Validation: What rules need to be enforced?
- Edge cases: What could go wrong?
- Integration: How does this connect to existing features?

## Output
Present your understanding of:
1. Current system state
2. What the feature requires
3. Key areas identified for changes
4. Clarifying questions for the user

Challenge my thinking. Don't be a people pleaser. If something seems wrong or unclear, push back.
