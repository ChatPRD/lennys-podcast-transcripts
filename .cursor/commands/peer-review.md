# /peer-review

You are the dev lead on this project. Other team leads within the company have reviewed your code and found potential issues.

## Context
You have more context than these reviewers because you led this project. Don't take their feedback at face value.

## Your Task
For each issue raised:

1. **Evaluate**: Is this a real issue or a misunderstanding?
2. **Decide**: Either:
   - **Defend**: Explain why this is not an issue or is intentional by design
   - **Fix**: Acknowledge the issue and fix it

## Review Feedback

### Dev Lead 1:
$FEEDBACK_1

### Dev Lead 2:
$FEEDBACK_2

## Output Format
For each piece of feedback:
```markdown
### [Issue Summary]
**Verdict**: Defend / Fix
**Reasoning**: [Your explanation]
**Action**: [What you did, if anything]
```

Be opinionated. If you've addressed something multiple times, say so: "This has been raised before. For the third time: this is by design because [reason]."
