# /update-docs

We've completed a feature or fixed a bug. Update the documentation so future agents can work better in this area.

## Your Task
1. Review what we just built/changed
2. Update relevant documentation:
   - README if needed
   - Code comments for complex logic
   - Architecture docs if patterns changed
   - Any markdown files that explain how this area works

## What to Document
- **What** was built and why
- **How** it works at a high level
- **Where** the key files are
- **Gotchas** or non-obvious decisions
- **Dependencies** on other parts of the system

## Postmortem Questions
If we encountered issues during development:
1. What mistakes did Claude make?
2. What in the system prompt or tooling led to those mistakes?
3. How can we prevent this in the future?

If updates to prompts or tooling are needed, suggest them.

## Goal
The next time an agent works in this area of the codebase, they should have the context they need to avoid repeating our mistakes.
